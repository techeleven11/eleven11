              <h3> Stat Attack </h3>

              <p> For all the CSK vs KXIP Fantasy cricket players, it is very vital to look at the major stats between these two teams performances : </p>

                <ul class="content_list pl-5">
                    <li> Kagiso Rabada has defended the lowest total in a super Over in IPL history and was the leading wicket taker last season, so he can be the DC vs KKR Fantasy Cricket Pick when these two teams play against each other. </li>

                    <li> ‌Andre Russell has hit a six every five balls in IPL 2019 edition. The Kolkata Knight Riders&#39; six-hitting machine has scored 257 runs at a staggering strike rate of 212.39. He can be the DC vs KKR Fantasy cricket pick because of his all-round match-winning ability with the bat and ball. </li>

                    <li> Prithvi Shaw has the highest individual score of 99 off 55 in the current setup of both the teams. </li>

                    <li> Sunil Narine has 20 wicket under his belt against <a href="javascript::"> DC,</a> which is the most by any current Kolkata
                         player. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3> DC vs KKR 2020 Battle to watch : </h3>

                <p> <strong> Andree Russell vs Kagiso Rabada </strong></p>

                <p> In the Delhi Capitals vs Kolkata Knight Riders match the battle to watch out for would be between the Muscle Russell vs 2019 Orange cap Holder. In the last year Super over clash, Rabada&#39;s knockout blow - an inch-perfect yorker - took out Russell&#39;s middle stump and left him on the floor. Russell will have that in the back of his mind and would like to even out the odds. </p>

                <p><strong> What to expect in DC vs KKR IPL 2020 : </strong></p>

                <p> The Kolkata Knight Riders vs Delhi Capitals live score will be dictated by the batsmen but the incredible list of bowlers which include newly added Pat Cummins in the KKR will surely bring in the fireworks. So, expect to see some highly entertaining cricket from the KKR vs DC match in <a href="<?= $path ;?>ipl"> IPL 2020 </a></p>
