                 <p> Their first encounter on the 19th April 2008 at Mohali Stadium was truly a great cricket for the fans present there.

It would be an amazing match to see the two Wicket Keeper Captains i.e. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (CSK) &amp; K L Rahul (KXIP) performing against each other. During the past few matches K L Rahul has come up as a legendary player not just as batsman but as wicket keeper as well. Due to this achievement currently he has been able to replace legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni as wicket keeper in Indian international team as well.
