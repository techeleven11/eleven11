                <h1> Mumbai Indians IPL 2020 </h1>
                
                <p>The <strong> Mumbai Indians IPL Team </strong> also known as MI is an IPL Franchise Cricket team based in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

The home ground for the MI is the Iconic world cup 2011 final Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Currently, <strong> Mumbai Indians IPL Team Captain </strong> is Indians best white ball cricket player Rohit Sharma. Mumbai Indians are the most successful team in the IPL as they have won the IPL title 4 times which is most by any team (Chennai Super Kings are right behind them with 3 titles).</p>

                <p> The 4 times IPL champion had the core settled with 24 players retained while 6 spots to be
                    filled. <strong> MI IPL team Owner </strong> Nita Ambani will be hoping for the same consistency from the defending champions and get back the trophy back home again in <a href="<?= $path; ?>ipl"> IPL 2020. </a>
                </p>

                <h3> Mumbai Indians IPL 2020: Auction Highlights </h3>
                
                <p> Mumbai Indians had a quite decent IPL this season as they had almost all the basis converted
                    and certainly looking for the backup options in the IPL Auction 2020. Before the Auction they
                    traded in Sherfane Rutherford, Trent Boult, Dhawal Kulkarni in place of Mayank Markande and
                    Siddhesh Lad. In the Auction, they were looking for the replacement mainly for the fast bowlers
                    so they have shelled in Nathan Coulter-Nile at 8 crores. Australian Opening basher Chris Lynn
                    was bought by them at the base price of 2 crores. He can a great pick this season if Quinton de
                    Kock is busy with the national duties. </p>

                <p> In total they have bought 6 players that includes Chris Lynn (2 crore), Nathan Coulter-Nile (8 crore), Saurabh Tiwary (50 lakh), Mohsin Khan (20 lakh), Digvijay Deshmukh (20 lakh), Balwant Rai Singh (20lakh) </p>

                <h3> MI IPL Team 2020: Final Squad </h3>

                <p> Rohit Sharma, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Anmolpreet Singh, Chris Lynn , Saurabh Tiwary, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga, Mitchell McClenaghan, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Mohsin Khan, Prince Balwant Rai Singh, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Anukul Roy, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Ishan Kishan, Quinton de Kock, Aditya Tare </p>

                <h3> Predicted Mumbai Indians IPL Team Captain </h3>

                <p> <a href="https://fsl11.com/blog/why-is-rohit-sharma-a-must-pick-for-the-fantasy-team/"> Rohit Sharma </a> has been the most successful captain in the IPL  history. Also he has been the leading run scorer for the Mumbai Indians. Under his leadership, Mumbai have won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019; they also won the former Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013. </p>

                <h3> Mumbai Indians Fantasy Cricket League Team </h3>

                <p> Now we will have a look towards the probable XI of <strong> MI Team Player </strong> that can be played in the first match. As we all know how important it is to know which players are playing in the match for a Fantasy gamer. Here you will get a glimpse of the MI Playing XI. </p>

                <p>Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the <strong> Mumbai Indians IPL team </strong> during the upcoming IPL season.</p>


                <h3> Openers: Rohit Sharma and Quinton De Kock/Chris Lynn </h3>

                <p><strong> Mumbai Indians IPL Team </strong> management have decided to go with Rohit Sharma as an opener rather than playing him in the middle order. Quinton De Kock seems to be settled in the role of the opening in the previous season and certainly be picked ahead of Chris Lynn, also he provides right left combination at the top which makes him 1st choice opener. It seems extremely tough for MI to accommodate Chris Lynn in the line-up unless they decide to slot Rohit Sharma down the order or bat Lynn at three; thus weakening the bowling attack. </p>

                <p>Rohit Sharma and De Kock have become the integral part of the<strong> MI Fantasy Cricket League
                Team</strong> so they won’t be tinkering with the pair.</p>

                <h3>Middle-order: Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Keiron Pollard, Krunal Pandya </h3>

                <p> Suryakumar should be batting at No.3 position His form in the domestic tournaments has been
                splendid and he seems to be at his best at the moment. This season can be the turning point in
                his career as he has been scoring bulk of the runs in domestic and India tour and with India
                looking for No 4 spot option, he can be the answer for this. Ishan Kishan, Pandya brothers and
                Pollard will act as a floater in the team and will play according to the situation. This middle
                order certainly look power packed and strong enough to beat any team.</p>

                <h3> Bowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Rahul Chahar, Lasith Malinga, Nathan Coulter Nile/ Trent Boult </h3>

                <p> With the current setup, MI has as many as 7 bowling options for them so bowlers will be picked
                according to the situation. Jasprit Bumrah will lead the pace attack along with the legendary
                and his role model Lasith Malinga. We certainly cannot forget the last year final where he
                delivered under pressure so he still has gas filled in his boots. Rahul Chahar is expect to lead the
                spin department along with Krunal Pandya. It will be a toss-up between Trent Boult and Nathan
                Coulter-Nile but with Trent Boult injury is concerned, Nathan could be the first choice fast
                bowler. </p>

                <h3> Mumbai Indians League Team: Best XI </h3>
                <p> Quinton de Kock (WK), Rohit Sharma (C), Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron
                Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult/Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jasprit Bumrah, and Lasith
                Malinga.</p>
