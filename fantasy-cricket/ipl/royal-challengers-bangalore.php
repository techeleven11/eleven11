                    <h1> Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL 2020 </h1>
                    
                    <p> The <strong> Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL Team </strong> also known as RCB is an IPL Franchise Cricket team. Currently, <strong> RCB IPL team owner </strong> is a liquor based company United Spirits. The home ground for the RCB is M Chinnaswamy Stadium situated in Bangalore. In 2014 RCB named Virat Kohli the captain of the team and since then, <strong> Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL Team Captain </strong> is Virat Kohli, The Royal Challengers have never won the <a href="<?= $path; ?>ipl"> IPL </a> but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016. Their lack of success over the years despite the star-studded lineup. The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL – 263/5 and 49 respectively.</p>


                    <p> The two-time IPL champion had retained 13 players and had 12 slots to fill, five solely for foreign players ahead of the auction. <strong> RCB IPL team Owner </strong> United Sprits (owned by Diageo), will be hoping for a better performance this season and would like to lift the trophy as the squad look in great shape with core India player and foreign experience </p>

                    <h3> RCB Team Players released before the Auction </h3>    
                    
                     <p> This is the list of players which were released by <strong> RCB IPL Team 2020 </strong> Auction:- </p>
                    
                     <p> Marcus Stoinis, Shimron Hetmyer, Akshdeep Nath, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Colin de Grandhomme, Prayas Ray Barman, Tim Southee, Kulwant Khejroliya, Himmat Singh, Heinrich Klaasen, Milind Kumar. </p>
                    
                    <h3> Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL 2020: Auction Highlights </h3>
                    
                    <p> RCB started the IPL 2020 auction with a bang as they went all out for Australia’s limited-overs captain Aaron Finch for Rs 4.40 crore before making their biggest purchase of the season in the form of South African Chris Morris. The Allrounder was sold for a whopping 10 crore in the auction (previously he was retained by DC in 7 crores). Every cricket expert thinks that certainly he is overprized by due to limited choice of quality death bowling specialist, they have to go all out for Morris. Kane Richardson was also a great pick at 4 crores, he has been part of the squad in the previous season, but his recent performance caught the eyes of the RCB Team management. They released Dale Steyn as he was injured in the late season but picked again as IPL 2020 certainly had limited choice of Fast bowlers. </p>

                    <p> They bought as many as 8 for the Auction 2020. Purchased players includes Australian captain Aaron Finch (4.4 crore), South African allrounder Chris Morris (10 crore), Australian Young wicket-keeper batsman Joshua Philippe (20 lakh), Australian Pacer Kane Richardson (4 crore), Allrounder Pavan Deshpande (20 lakh), South African Pacer Dale Steyn (2 crore), Allrounder Shahbaz Ahamad (20 lakh), Srilankan pacer Isuru Udana (50 lakh) </p>

                    <h3> RCB IPL Team 2020: Final Squad </h3>

                    <p> Devdutt Padikkal, Joshua Phillippe, Shahbaz Ahmad, Virat Kohli (c), Kane Richardson, Parthiv Patel (wk), Isuru Udana, Umesh Yadav, Pavan Deshpande, Yuzvendra Chahal, Chris Morris, AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn, Pawan Negi, Aaron Finch, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Navdeep Saini, Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Moeen Ali, Mohammad Siraj </p>

                    <h3> Predicted Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL Team Captain </h3>

                    <p> The Indian team captain Virat Kohli has been the run machine in every format of the game, but certainly, his individual performance doesn’t reflect his IPL team’s success as he is yet to lift an IPL Trophy. In the year 2016, he sat at top on the leading run-scorers list, scoring 4 hundred in a single season thereby donning the Orange Cap at the end of the ninth edition of the league. With the help of ABD and Finch and some Indian young guns who have tasted the flavor of International cricket, he could finally break through the Jinx. </p>

                    <h3> Royal Challengers Bangalore Fantasy Cricket League Team </h3>

                    <p> Now we will have a look towards the probable XI of <strong> RCB Team Player </strong> that can be played in the first match. As we all know how important it is to know which players are playing in the match for a Fantasy gamer. Here you will get a glimpse of the RCB Playing XI. 
                    </p>

                    <p> Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the <strong> Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL </strong> team during the upcoming IPL season. </p>

                    <h3> Openers: Parthiv Patel and Aaron Finch </h3>

                    <p> <strong> Royal Challengers Bangalore IPL Team </strong> management is expected to go with these two for the opening slot. Parthiv Patel will be donning the wicket keeping duties and have a specific role in the power play that is to attack the bowler and get his team to a good start. Aaron Finch is an experienced campaigner and certainly on the most destructive batsman in the International format. If he gets going, he can win you matches single-handedly. </p>

                    <p> Both of these players are an integral part of the <strong> RCB Fantasy Cricket League Team.</strong> The other likely choice for the opening slot can be Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal. </p>

                    <h3> Middle-order: Virat Kohli, AB De Villiers, Shivam Dube, Moeen Ali, Chris Morris </h3>

                    <p> Their middle-order now looking much stronger with the boost of Shivam Dube and Moeen Ali.
                        Virat Kohli has opened the innings in the previous season but things could change in this
                        season. With WCT20 in the offing, his batting and captaincy will be tested in the most heated T20 League. AB De Villiers has recently shown some signs of coming back to international cricket after retiring in the previous year. So this season will be crucial for him to put his name into the South African contention. Shivam Dube, Moeen Ali and Chris Morris will act as a floater in the team. </p>

                    <h3> Bowlers: Yuzvendra Chahal, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar </h3>

                    <p> With the current setup, RCB has as many as 7 bowling options for them so bowlers will be picked according to the situation. Washington has been in the Indian squad for a year so he has got the experience of the same. He bowls tight lines in the powerplay and gives nothing to the batsman. Yuzi Chahal will be leading the bowling pool as he has got the most wickets in Chinnaswamy Stadium. He bowls tough overs for the team and gets them break through. Umesh Yadav and Navdeep Saini will be leading the pace attack along with Chris Morris.</p>

                    <p> The other option in the fast bowlers in Mohammad Siraj, Dale Steyn, and Kane Richardson </p>

                    <h3> Royal Challengers Bangalore League Team: Best XI </h3>
                    <p> Aaron Finch, Parthiv Patel (wk), Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Devdutt Padikkal/Moeen Ali, Shivam Dube/Washington Sundar, Chris Morris, Yuzvendra Chahal, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini</p>
