                    <h3> History of DC vs MI IPL match : </h3>

                    <p> They faced each other for the first time on 4 May 2008 at the DY Patil Sports Academy in Mumbai. MI set DC a target of 163. Delhi fell short by a big margin of 29 runs and were all out for just 133. Ashish Nehra, Shaun Pollock and Dhawal Kulkarni bagged three, two and two wickets each. In the last outing between these teams, Hardik Pandya was declared MOM for his blitz 40. </p>

                    <p> It is to be noted with the great surprise that Rajasthan Royals won all the matches against Chennai Super kings in CSK vs RR IPL match in 2008. Infact, the first IPL Final of the First Season of Indian Premier League was played between CSK and RR only on 1st June 2008 at Mumbai where RR bagged the trophy under its title by defeating CSK with 3 wickets. </p>
