                <h3> History of CSK vs RCB match : </h3>    
                
                 <p>The first time these two teams from Southern Darby teams of India met in the IPL was on 28 April 2008. That time CSK won by 13 runs. The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) were banned for 2 years for their involvement in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. After this ban was lifted, CSK renewed their rivalry with RCB on 25 April 2018. 
                 </p>
                 
                 <p> The teams came face to face in a group league match during the 2018 Indian Premier League. Chennai Super Kings have always been the better of the two teams as they are the most successful team in the history of IPL with the best win percentage when compared to other teams (61%). They have always qualified for the playoffs in all the 12 editions and won the title 3 times. On the other contrary, the Royal Challengers Bangalore seems to suffer from issues of consistency, as they have finished both at the bottom and the top ends of the table over the years. </p>
