                <h3> Rajasthan Royal Fantasy Cricket League Team </h3>

                <p> Now we will have a look towards the probable XI of <strong> RR Team Player </strong> that can be played in the first match. As we all know how important it is to know which players are playing in the match for a Fantasy gamer. Here you will get a glimpse of the RR Playing XI. </p>

                <p>Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the <strong> Rajasthan Royals IPL</strong> team during the upcoming IPL season. </p>


                <h3> Openers: Jos Buttler and Robin Uthappa </h3>

                <p><strong> Rajasthan Royals IPL Team </strong> management will likely to introduce these 2 experienced Duo of Jos Buttler and Robin Uthappa. The English explosive batsmen who also do wicket keeping duty for his team will open the batting for the team. He can win match for his team single-handedly and can be a very dangerous batsmen. Robin Uthappa is the new addition to the team and is a player who has got a great experience in the Indian Premier League and he is likely to continue his batting form for the new franchise also. He plays at top and knows how to stay till the end of the innings and take the team home. </p>

                <p>Both of these players are the integral part of the <strong> RR Fantasy Cricket League Team.</strong> The other likely choice for the opening slot can be Yashasvi Jaiswal.</p>

                <h3>Middle-order: Steve Smith, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes Riyan Parag </h3>

                <p> Steve Smith missed the 2018 season due to his ball-tampering ban, but the former Australian
                    captain was back into the leadership role at the backend of last years’. He is expected to bat at No.3 slot as he is the best batsman in the team. Sanju Samson has been in the Indian squad for a while now and haven’t got any opportunity to prove himself, though he opened for India in
                    the 2 games against New Zealand but couldn’t make it count. This season will be very crucial for
                    him. 2019 was the year of Ben Stokes whether it was ODI cricket or Test match. He is the best
                    all-round on this planet and RR would be pleased to have him, though he hasn’t best of IPL last season but things can change this year. Riyan Parag  showed glimpses of his talent last season
                    and proved himself in the limited opportunity he got. The allrounder became the youngest
                    cricketer to score a half-century in the history of the IPL. In seven games, Parag scored 160 runs at an average of 32 and a strike-rate 126.98.</p>

                <h3> Bowlers:Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Javdev Unadkat, Ankit Rajpoot,Mayank Markande </h3>

                <p> Jofra Archer is expected to lead the pace attack, his varations and gun yorkers have made life
                    difficult for the batsman at the backend of the Innings. He has certain provided RR the cushion
                    in the death.Javdev Unadkat will be sharing the old ball duties along with him. He was removed
                    from the squad then bought back at very less price tag. He had pretty decent domestic matches
                    to support his confidence. Ankit Rajpoot was a great inclusion in the squad. He brings pace and
                    bounce along with swing and seam with the new ball. Shreyas Gopal will led the spin
                    department along with the Mayank Markande who was traded in by MI against Kulkarni. Both of
                    these wrist spinners will play crucial role in the middle overs as we have seen IPL 2019 has all
                    about leg spinners.</p>

                <p> Jos Buttler (WK), Robin Uthappax Sanju Samson, Steve Smith (C), Ben Stokes, Riyan Parag,
                    Shreyas Gopal, Jofra Archer, Mayank Markhande, Ankit Rajpoot, and Jaydev Unadkat </p>
