In the recent, Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he aggregated 314 runs in just 9 matches at a magnificent average of 78.50 and a strike-rate of 164.39. His performance will be really crucial for him to break out into India WCT20 squad. U19 captain Priyam Garg will be player to watch out for in this IPL while Vijay Shankar and Rashid Khan will be performing the Allrounder duties. </p>

                <h3> Bowlers: Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed, Shahbaz Nadeem, Siddhart Kaul/Sandeep Sharma </h3>
