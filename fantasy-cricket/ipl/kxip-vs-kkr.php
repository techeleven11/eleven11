                <h1> KXIP vs KKR IPL Fantasy Cricket Match 2020 </h1>

                <p> The current captain of the Knights is wicket-keeper batsman, Dinesh Karthik, who has recently gained a reputation of a T20 finisher especially after the last ball-6 victory of Bangladesh. Meanwhile,<a href="kings-xi-punjab"> Kings XI Punjab </a> will led by the new captain KL Rahul. Both teams have tweaked their strategies and brought in some big-name </p>

                <p> Earlier Kings XI Punjab vs Kolkata Knight Riders match was played as per the schedule decided by the
                    BCCI but since the Covid-19 situation, the <a href="<?= $path ;?>ipl"> IPL has been postponed till April 15, 2020,</a> so there is no new scheduled posted by IPL committee. Let’s Discuss KXIP vs KKR fantasy cricket news, head to head clashes and what we can expect in when KKR and KXIP combat against each other. </p>

                <h3> History of KXIP vs KKR IPL match : </h3>    
                
                 <p> The Kolkata Knight Riders vs Kings XI Punjab match has always been a nail-biting affair. When you      look at the Kings XI Punjab, apart from the 2014 season when they topped the league table and          finished  runners-up, KXIP team has made only one other playoff appearance in 12 seasons. Kolkata      Knight Riders  have clichéd the trophy 2 times, 2012 and 2014 (defeating Chennai Super Kings and       Kings XI Punjab).
                </p>

              <h3> Stat Attack </h3>

                <ul class="content_list pl-5">
                    <li> KL Rahul has been in amazing form from the past 2 seasons. In 28 matches, he has managed to
                        score more than 1200 runs at an average of 54 with the highest score of unbeaten 100*. He can
                        be the KXIP vs KKR Fantasy cricket as captaincy would relish and enhance his game in this
                        edition. </li>

                    <li> ‌Andre Russell has hit a six every five balls in IPL 2019 edition. The Kolkata Knight Riders&       #39; six-hitting machine has scored 510 runs at a staggering strike rate of 212.39. He can be       the KXIP vs KKR Fantasy cricket pick because of his all-round match-winning ability with the        bat and ball. </li>

                    <li> Sunil Narine is the leading wicket taker (26) when these two teams have played against each
                         other. Also, he has the best bowling figures of 5/19 against KXIP. </li>

                    <li> 245/6 is the highest score against Kings XI Punjab in which Sunil Narine scored 75 off just 36
                         balls. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3> KXIP vs KKR 2020 Battle to watch : </h3>

                <p> <strong> Andre Russell vs Mujeeb Ur Rahman </strong></p>

                <p> In the Kings XI Punjab match vs Kolkata Knight Riders the battle to watch out for would be between
                    Muscle Russell and Afghan spinner. Another battle between a big hitter and a spinner to watch out for is this one. Mujeeb bowls well at pretty much every juncture of the match, and would be Punjab&#39;s trump card against Russell. </p>

                <p><strong> What to expect in KKR vs KXIP IPL 2020 : </strong></p>

                <p> The Kings XI Punjab vs Kolkata Knight Riders will be full of runs and fireworks both the teams possess firepower in the batting lineup. If BCCI decides to continue the <a href="<?= $path ; ?>ipl"> IPL 2020 </a> then expect to see some highly entertaining cricket from the KXIP vs KKR match.  </p>
