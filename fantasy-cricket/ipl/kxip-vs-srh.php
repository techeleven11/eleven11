              <h3> Stat Attack </h3>

                <ul class="content_list pl-5">
                    <li> KL Rahul has been in amazing form from the past 2 seasons. In 28 matches, he has managed to
                         score more than 1200 runs at an average of 54 with the highest score of unbeaten 100*. He can be the KXIP vs SRH Fantasy cricket as captaincy would relish and enhance his game in this edition. </li>

                    <li> ‌David Warner is the leading run-scorer of the side, having won 3 Orange Cap in 2015, 2017 and
                         2019 so he can be the best choice for captain for KXIP vs SRH Fantasy cricket match. </li>

                    <li> Bhuvenshwar Kumar is the leading wicket-taker (18) when these two teams played against each
                         other. </li>

                    <li> David Warner is also leading the most runs scored against KXIP with 574 runs. </li>

                <h3> KXIP vs SRH 2020 Battle to watch : </h3>

                <p> <strong> Rashid Khan vs Chris Gayle </strong></p>

                <p> In the Kings XI Punjab vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match the battle to watch out for would be between
                    Gayle Storm and Afghan rockstar Rashid. One is the best T20 leg spinner while other is arguably the
                    greatest T20 Batsman of all time. On April 19, 2018, Chris Gayle took on Rashid Khan and he won. He hit only 1 four but bashed 11 sixes in 63-ball 104 to leave Rashid and Sunrisers Hyderabad dazed. Rashid has a weakness against left-hander which he might have worked out for this season. </p>

                <p><strong> What to expect in SRH vs KXIP IPL 2020 : </strong></p>

                <p> The Kings XI Punjab vs Sunrisers Hyderabad will be an entertaining contest between bat and ball. If BCCI decides to continue the <a href="<?= $path ; ?>ipl"> IPL 2020 </a> then expect to see some highly entertaining cricket from the KXIP vs SRH match.</p>
