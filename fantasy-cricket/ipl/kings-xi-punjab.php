                <h3> Kings XI Punjab Fantasy Cricket League Team </h3>

                <p> Now we will have a look towards the probable XI of <strong> KXIP Team Player </strong> that can be played in the first match. As we all know how important it is to know which players are playing in the match for a Fantasy gamer. Here you will get a glimpse of the KXIP Playing XI.</p>

                <p>Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the <strong> Kings XI Punjab IPL team </strong> during the <a href="<?= $path; ?>ipl"> upcoming IPL season.</a> </p>

                <h3> Openers: KL Rahul and Chris Gayle </h3>

                <p><strong> Kings XI Punjab IPL Team </strong> management will likely to stick with these 2 experienced Duo of KL Rahul and Chris Gayle. The West Indian explosive batsmen also know as universe boss will open the batting for the team. He can win match for his team single-handedly and can be a dangerous batsmen. KL Rahul is the captain of the team and is a player who has been in great form in the International team and he is likely to continue his great form for his team also. He plays at top and knows how to stay till the end of the innings and take the team home. </p>

                <p>Both of these players are the integral part of the <strong> KXIP Fantasy Cricket League Team.</strong> The other likely choice for the opening slot can be Mayank Agarwal.</p>

                <h3> Middle-order: Mayank Agarwal, Nicholas Pooran, Glenn Maxwell, Deepak Hooda and
                     Krishnappa Gowtham </h3>

                <p> This team has got a stable middle order with few experienced and few youngster. The No.3
                    Spot will be handled by Mayank Agarwal who has shown his class in test cricket for India. There
                    are a lot of expectation from him. As he has done very well in domestic circuit too. And this is
                    the time that he can prove to selectors that he can play T20 cricket as well. Glenn Maxwell and
                    Nicholas Pooran can be used as floater and will have a major duty to take the team to big totals. We all know what both of them are capable of doing especially, the Aussie All-Rounder Glenn  Maxwell. As he can role his arm for the team as he bowls spin quite well and is a wonderful fielder. Deepak Hooda and Krishnappa Gowtham are the two Indian all-rounder who will do late hitting duty and will also bowl some overs for the team. </p>

                <h3> Bowlers: Mohammed Shami, Sheldon Cottrell, Murgan Ashwin and Ishan Porel </h3>

                <p> Mohammed Shami is presently playing in the best bowling form of his life for Team India. And, if he tended to reproduce his form in <a href="<?= $path; ?>ipl"> IPL 2020 </a> then the possibilities for KXIP to win their maiden IPL trophy will surely boost. Shami will be having the duty to help KXIP in reaping early wickets with the new ball and his four-over spell will be quite important for his side going into the IPL 2020. Sheldon Cottrell will be partnering Mohammed Shami in death overs as he has got great success for his national side and considering his price. He is likely to make a place in KXIP Playing XI. Murgan Ashwin is expected to be the leading front line spinner for the Kings XI Punjab IPL team. Murgan Ashwin&#39;s style of bowling will be well-suited to the home pitch of KXIP, and his current form will be of great help. Another player who will be player to watch out for is the Indian fast bowler Ishan Porel.</p>

                <h3> Kings XI Punjab Fantasy Cricket League Team: Best XI </h3>
                <p> JKL Rahul, Chris Gayle, Mayank Agarwal, Nicholas Pooran, Glenn Maxwell, Deepak Hooda, Krishnappa
                    Gowtham, Mohammed Shami, Sheldon Cottrell, Murgan Ashwin and Ishan Porel </p>
