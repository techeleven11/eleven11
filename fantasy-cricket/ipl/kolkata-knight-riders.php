                <h3> Predicted Kolkata Knight Riders IPL Team Captain </h3>

                <p> Dinesh Karthik has been named as franchise captain even after the inclusion Eoin Morgan. </p>

                <p> Having entered the team in 2018 (earlier the captaincy role was handled by Gautam Gambhir), He has finished two seasons with the team as a role for wicket keeper batsman who plays a part of a finisher in the team. He had some great innings and many unbeaten knock which took his team home comfortably.

                <p> Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the <strong> Kolkata Knight Riders IPL team </strong> during the <a href="<?= $path; ?>ipl "> upcoming IPL season.</a> </p>


                <h3> Openers: Sunil Narine and Shubhman Gill </h3>

                <p><strong> Kolkata Knight Riders IPL Team </strong> management is expect go with these two for the opening slot after Chris Lynn and Robin Uthappa being dropped from this year squad. All eyes will be on Shubhman Gill, with limited opportunities they have got, he has got all eyes lit up the audience with his audacious shot making. He is one for the future. </p>

                <p>Both of these players are the integral part of the <strong> KKR Fantasy Cricket League Team.</strong> The other likely choice for the opening slot can be Siddhesh Lad and Tom Banton. </p>

                <h3>Middle-order: Nitesh Rana, Andre Russell, Dinesh Kartik, Eoin Morgan, Rinku Singh </h3>

                <p> This team has got a stable middle order with experience of Dinesh Kartik and Eoin Morgan and
                    young guns. Nitesh Rana has done good enough for KKR to retain him for the upcoming season.
                    Last time around, the Delhi batsman scored 344 runs at 34.40 with a strike-rate of 146.38. He
                    also bowled some decent part time off spin. The Muscle Russell is again expected to be the
                    player to watch out for, he had a great season with the bat last season Batting mostly at six or
                    even seven, he got 510 runs at an average of 56.66 and strike rate of almost 200. Dinesh Kartik,
                    Eoin Morgan and Rinku Singh will handle the lower middle and finishing role</p>

                <h3> Bowlers: Kamlesh Naragkoti, Pat Cummins, Prasidh Krishna, Kuldeep Yadav </h3>

                <p> They have got the most inexperienced yet talented Fast Bowling pool headed by Pat Cummins. In 16 IPL games, Cummins only has 17 wickets, but his form for the Aussies made him a hot pick in the auction. Kamlesh has been retained by KKR for almost 2 years without being played a single match due to foot injury. He is fit and expected to be part of the playing XI along with death specialist Prasidh KrishnaThe spin department will be handled by the likes of Narine and Kuldeep Kuldeep being seen as one of India’s key elements for the T20 World Cup. Prior to the tournament, Yadav will be looking for a good outing in the IPL. </p>

                <h3> Kings XI PunjabFantasy Cricket League Team: Best XI </h3>

                <p> Shubhman Gil, Sunil Narine, Nitesh Rana, Dinesh Kartik, Eoin Morgan, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh,
                    Kamlesh Nagarkoti/Shivam Mavi, Kuldeep Yadav, Pat Cummins, Prasidh Krishna </p>
