                <h3> History of KKR vs SRH IPL match : </h3>    
                
                 <p> Hyderabad have won the IPL title in 2016 while Kolkata has won the IPL trophy two times (2012 and
                     2014) under the leadership of Gautam Gambhir. Both the teams, KKR and SRH have been almost neck to
                     neck in Head to Head comparisons. These statistics suggest nothing but one thing, neither KKR nor SRH have been able to dominate the other. On their first-ever IPL encounter on 14th of April 2013, the Knights defeated the Sunrisers at Kolkata. Their last encounter, however, resulted in a Sunrisers Victory  when they defeated <a href="kolkata-knight-riders"> KKR </a> comfortable with 9 wickets in hand and chased down total of 160 odd comfortably.
