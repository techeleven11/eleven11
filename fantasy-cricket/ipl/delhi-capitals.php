                    <h1> Delhi Capital IPL 2020 </h1>
                    
                    <p> Delhi Capital will be one of the toughest competitors when we talk about <a href="<?= $path?>ipl"> IPL 2020 </a> edition.

As in the last season the team lost in eliminator round.</p>


                    <p> Given the extreme advancement seen in the execution of the Capitals team last season, the 
                        <strong> DC IPL Team Owners </strong> have done well to not fiddle around with their team too much. <strong> Delhi Capital IPL Team Captain </strong> Shreyas Iyer will be leading the team once again, while most of the youngsters are expected to be retained as the team builds towards the next few years. Delhi Capitals traded hard-hitting Windies all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford for Mumbai Indians Mayank Markande before the auction.</p>

                    <h3> DC Team Players released before the Auction </h3>

                    <p> Delhi Capitals were very smart when considering them in the auction. <strong> DC IPL Team 2020 </strong> were boosted with the addition of some big players as they took a total of 8 players in the auction. The management spent a whopping 18.85 crores together to get new 
                    <strong> DC Team Players. </strong></p>

                    <h3> DC IPL Team 2020: Final Squad </h3>

                    <p> Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Jason Roy, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada, Keemo Paul, Mohit Sharma, Lalit Yadav, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Marcus Stoinis, Chris Woakes, Rishabh Pant, Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande. </p>

                    <h3> Predicted Delhi Capital IPL Team Captain </h3>

                    <p> Shreyas Iyer is expected to lead the Delhi Capital team. As he did very well in the last season for the team and he took the team to the playoffs. Iyer has been in outstanding form and can play a major role in the team with the bat. He would be again tested as it is a young team
                    and he has to show his international experience this season. </p>

                    <h3> Delhi Capital Fantasy Cricket League Team </h3>

                    <p> Now we will have a look towards the probable XI which Delhi Capitals might play. As we all know how important it is to know which players are playing in the match for a Fantasy gamer. Here you will get a glimpse of the core team of Delhi Capitals. </p>

                    <p> Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the Delhi Capitals team during the upcoming IPL season. </p>

                    <h3> Openers: Shikhar Dhawan and Jason Roy </h3>

                    <p> <strong> Delhi Capital IPL </strong> Team management would be wanting that two power pack players should be opening the batting for the team. Shikhar Dhawan has been exceptional in IPL and you can&#39;t remove him from the top order. Whereas Jason Roy would fit in the opening pair as he is right-handed explosive batsmen which will make a great combination. </p>

                    <p> Both of them will be an eternal part of <strong> DC Fantasy Cricket </strong> League Team. The other choices for the openers are Ajinkya Rahane and Prithvi Shaw. </p>

                    <h3> Middle-order: Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer (c), Rishabh Pant (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Ravichandran Ashwin </h3>

                    <p> The middle order of the team looks quite strong with some power hitting options as well as some dependable players. If the top order of
                    the team fails then Ajinkya Rahane and Shreyas Iyer can be a
                    dependable option. Whereas Rishabh Pant and Shimron Hetmyer will
                    be the power hitter for the team who can change the match anytime
                    towards their team.</p>

                    <p> Ravichandran Ashwin and Harshal Patel will be responsible for the late
                    hitting duty. As if the middle order also fails then they can get the team
                    to a decent score.</p>

                    <h3> Lower order: Chris Woakes, Kagiso Rabada, Amit Mishra, Ishant Sharma </h3>

                    <p> The pace department of the team will be lead by the lethal bowler
                    Kagiso Rabada who will be supported by bowling all-rounder Chris
                    Woakes and Ishant Sharma. The pace bowling looks very strong with all
                    wicket-taking options. Whereas when we talk about the spin
                    department Amit Mishra and Ravichandran Ashwin will be the
                    experienced duo who would be responsible to take wickets in middle overs. These two are among the leading wicket-takers in the history of
                    IPL.</p>

                    <h3> DC Fantasy Cricket League Team: Best XI </h3>

                    <p> Shikhar Dhawan, Jason Roy, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer (c), Rishabh
                    Pant (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Chris Woakes, R Ashwin, Ishant Sharma,
                    Kagiso Rabada, Amit Mishra. </p>

                    <h3> Weakness of Delhi Capitals </h3>

                    <p> Overall, Delhi Capitals looks quite strong as a team on paper. But there
                    is some sort of trouble that the team might face. <strong> Delhi Capitals Fantasy </strong>
                    <strong> Cricket League team </strong> lacks a quality all-rounder. As Chris Woakes and
                    Ravichandran Ashwin are bowlers only. Harshal Patel can play that part
                    as he has done very well in domestic leagues.</p>
