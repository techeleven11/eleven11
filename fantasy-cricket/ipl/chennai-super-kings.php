                <h3> Predicted Chennai Super Kings IPL Team Captain </h3>

                <p> All eyes will again be on the veteran Mahendra Singh Dhoni who has been wondering from the
                    cricket ever since the World Cup semi final against New Zealand. He hasn’t played any form of
                    cricket for more than 6 months (which resulted in removal from BCCI contract), so it will be
                    interesting to see how he approach this season of IPL, though he will be targeting the upcoming
                    T20 world cup, so this IPL 2020 will be very crucial for him if he needs a place in the India side. </p>

                <h3> Chennai Super Kings Fantasy Cricket League Team </h3>

                <p> Now we will have a look towards the probable XI CSK Team Player that can be played in the first
                    match. As we all know how important it is to know which players are playing in the match for a
                    Fantasy gamer. Here you will get a glimpse of the CSK Playing XI. </p>

                <p> Now let us take a look at the best possible combination for the Chennai Super Kings team during the upcoming IPL season. </p>


                <h3> Openers: Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis </h3>
                <p> Chennai Super Kings IPL Team management will likely to stick with these 2 experienced Duo of
                Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis. The former Australian has been playing T20 league all around
                the globe after retirement from international cricket. His match-winning hundred in the 2018
                final being followed by a fighting knock in the narrow 2019 loss will give him the much deserved
                opening slot. The Proteas skipper frequently open the innings for the CSK as found great
                success at the top of the order, his ability to play spin and seam makes him perfect player for
                that spot. </p>
                <p> Both of these players are the integral part of the CSK Fantasy Cricket League Team. The other
                likely choice for the opening slot can be Ambati Rayadu.</p>

                <h3> Middle-order: Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni (c &amp; wk), Kedhar Jadhav, Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayn Bravo </h3>

                <p> This team has got the most experienced middle order across all team. The No.3 Spot will be
                    handled by Suresh Raina who is the most consistent player in the IPL. The southpaw has never
                    scored below 300 runs in any edition of the IPL, though this year his form will be a major
                    concern as he is coming from a surgery and hasn’t played any competitive cricket since then.
                    MS Dhoni is expect to move one slot up the order in this season, though he has mentioned that
                    his place would be flexible and according to the team situation. He will be the vital cog in the
                    wheel in which the team sticks around. Then the Finishers Job will be handed over to Kedhar
                    Jadhav, Ravindra Jadeja and Dwayne Bravo (who recently has taken off his retirement from T20
                    cricket) </p>

                <h3> Bowlers: Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Shardul Thakur, Lungi Ngidi </h3>

                <p> Deepak Chahar has grown from strength to strength in the last couple of years, his consistent
                    performance in the IPL has earned him national call up. Deepak Chahar has claimed the best-ever T20I bowling figures, with 6-7. India seamer Deepak Chahar has recorded the best-ever

                    Twenty20 International bowling figures in his side&#39;s series-clinching win over Bangladesh.
                    Shardul Thakur has been in and out of the Indian side for quite a while now, thanks to his
                    recurring injuries. But the Mumbai pacer, known for his hit-the-deck kind of bowling, has
                    improved a lot with the white ball. His place will depend upon the venue and the pitch. Either
                    of him/Harbhajan can make into the playing XI. Lungi Ngidi will joining the duties with the new
                    ball and bowling hard length in the middle overs. Piyush Chawla is expected to be the leading
                    front line spinner for the Chennai Super Kings IPL team. Chawla&#39;s style of bowling will be well-suited to the home pitch of CSK, and his years of experience will be of great help. He adds to the batting depth too. </p>

                <p> Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne
                    Bravo, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Shardul Thakur/Harbhajan, Lungi Ngidi </p>
