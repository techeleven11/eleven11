                          <h5> 1. How to withdraw money from my FSL11 account? </h5>
                          <p>You can withdraw money from the winnings account in your FSL11 wallet once your account is verified. This verification is a one-time process and doesn’t need to be repeated unless you wish to make changes to your account. Once your account is verified, you can withdraw the desired amount (min. INR 200 and max. INR 9,999 at a time) and it will be deposited into your bank account within five working days.</p>

                          <h5> 2. Why can’t I withdraw the Cash Bonus in my FSL11 account? </h5>
                          <p>This is a bonus amount given by&nbsp;<a href="authenticate?type=signup" target="_blank">FSL11.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;to you. This amount is non-withdrawable and can be used to join more contests and win more cash. Also, make sure to use the received Cash Bonus as it comes with an expiry date.</p>

                          <h5> 3. What is the minimum &amp; maximum amount I can withdraw from my FSL11 account? </h5>
                          <p>The minimum amount for a single withdrawal request is INR 200 and the maximum amount that you can withdraw in one go is INR 9,999. One time deposit of INR 30 is the minimum criteria to be eligible for withdrawal.</p>

                          <h5> 4. What bank account details do I need to provide for withdrawal/verification? </h5>
                          <p> We’ve got to make sure that it’s you who we’re sending the money to. Hence, we need you to provide the bank account details including the following information:- Name of the bank, Name of the branch, Name of the account holder, Account no. and IFSC code.</p>

                          <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Leaderboards</strong></h4>

                          <p><strong>Q: How do Leaderboard Rankings work?</strong></p>

                          <p dir="ltr"><strong>A: &nbsp;Leaderboard Rankings are based on the total of fantasy points accumulated by the top teams created for the matches during a series or the period for which the Leaderboard is active. </strong></p>

                          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In case you played with more than 1 team in a multi-entry match, only the Team with Highest Fantasy Points will be considered for leaderboard rankings.</p>

                          <p><strong>Q: What are the different types of Leaderboards?</strong></p>

                          <p dir="ltr"><strong>A: Leaderboards are broadly divided into 2 categories:</strong></p>

                          <p><strong>1. Series/Tournament Leaderboards</strong></p>

                          <p dir="ltr">These leaderboards keep a track of a player’s performance on a per series basis. For eg., If there’s a 5-match ODI series, the fantasy points of the best team in each of those 5 matches for an individual player will be accumulated for the leaderboard.</p>

                          <p><strong>2. Weekly/Monthly Leaderboards </strong></p>

                          <p>These leaderboards keep a track of a player’s performance on a per week/month basis. For eg., If there are 10 matches happening in a week, the fantasy points of the best team in each of those respective matches in which the player has participated will be accumulated for the leaderboard.</p>

                          <p><strong>Q: Which teams are considered for Leaderboards?</strong></p>

                          <p dir="ltr"><strong>A: </strong>Only the teams that have been enrolled in a cash contest will be considered for the Leaderboard!</p>

                          <p><strong>Q: How much time does it take to declare Leaderboard Winnings?</strong></p>

                          <p dir="ltr"><strong>A: </strong>After the last match of a particular series/week/month ends, it takes 24 hours at least for us to display the final leaderboard score!</p>

                          <h4><strong>Refer &amp; Earn</strong></h4>

                          <p>1: When I will get my referral bonus?<br>
                          You will get Rs.100 when your referral will make a minimum deposit of Rs. 30.</p>

                          <h4>Account Balance</h4>

                          <p>Here, you can see the total balance in your FSL11 account and can either deposit/withdraw money. Remember, you need to get your account verified by us to withdraw money. Don’t worry! This is a one-time activity unless you wish to change your account details.</p>
