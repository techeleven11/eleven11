							<h4>Payment Terms</h4>
                            <BLOCKQUOTE type="disc">
                            <li>In respect of any transactions entered into on the FSL11, including making a payment to participate in the paid versions of Contests, Players agree to be bound by the following payment terms:</li>

                            <li>The payment Players make to participate in the Contests is inclusive of the nominated fee for access to the FSL11 Services charged by FSL11. Subject to these Terms and Conditions, all other amounts collected from the Player are held in escrow until determination of the Winners and distribution of prizes.</li>

                            <li>The FSL11 portal hosts a number of Contests for which it reserves the right to charge a Platform Fee, which would be specified and notified by FSL11 on the Contest page prior to a Player's joining of such Contest. The Platform Fee and applicable tax thereon will be debited from the Player’s account balance along with the entry-fee for the Contest, and FSL11 shall issue an invoice for such debit to the Player.</li>

                            <li>The Player may participate in a Contest wherein the Player has to contribute a pre-specified contribution towards the Prize Money Pool of such Contest, which will be passed on to the Winners of the Contest after the completion of the Contest as per the terms and conditions of such Contest. It is clarified that FSL11 has no right or interest in this Prize Money Pool, and only acts as an intermediary engaged in collecting and distributing the Prize Money Pool in accordance with the Contest terms and conditions. The amount to be paid-in by the Player towards the Prize Money Pool would also be debited from the Player’s account balance with FSL11.</li>

                            <li>FSL11 provides players with three categories of accounts for the processing and reconciliation of payments in relation to the FSL11 Services: (a) Deposit Account, (b) Winnings Account, and (c) Cash Bonus Account.</li>

                            <li>The Player's winnings in any Contest will reflect as credits to the Player's Winnings Account. It is clarified that in no instance will FSL11 permit the transfer of any amounts in the Player's accounts to any other category of account held by the player with FSL11 or any third party account, including a bank account held by a third party.</li>

                            <li>Players shall be required to remit the required amount to FSL11 through the designated payment gateway. The payment made shall be credited to the Player’s accounts and each time a Player enters a round, the applicable amount towards participation in the round shall be debited from the Player’s account. In debiting amounts from the Player’s accounts towards the participation fee of such player in any round or Contests, FSL11 shall first debit the Player’s Cash Bonus Account (in accordance with any rules or limitations relating to the use of Cash Bonus as may be prescribed by FSL11 and applicable at such time) , thereafter, any remaining amount of participation fee shall be debited from the Player’s Deposit Account and thereafter, any remaining amount of participation fee shall be debited from the Player’s Winning Account. In case there is any amount remaining to be paid by the Player in relation to such Player’s participation in any rounds or Contests, the Player will be taken to the designated payment gateway to give effect to such payment. In case any amount added by the Player through such payment gateway exceeds the remaining amount of participation fee, the amount in excess shall be transferred to the Player’s ‘Deposit’ Account and will be available for use in participation in any rounds or Contests or for withdrawal in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Debits from the ‘Deposit’ Account for the purpose of enabling a player’s participation in a Contest shall be made in order of the date of credit of amounts in the ‘Deposit’ Account, and accordingly amounts credited into ‘Deposit’ Account earlier in time shall be debited first.</li>

                            <li>A Player shall be permitted to withdraw any amounts credited into such Player's 'Deposit' Account for any reason whatsoever by contacting FSL11 Customer Support. All amounts credited into a Player's 'Deposit' Account must be utilised within 335 days of credit. In case any unutilised amount lies in the 'Deposit' Account after the completion of 335 days from the date of credit of such amount, FSL11 reserves the right to forfeit such unutilised amount, without liability or obligation to pay any compensation to the Player.</li>

                            <li>Withdrawal of any amount standing to the Player's credit in the Winnings Account may be made by way of a request to FSL11 but shall occur automatically upon completion of 335 days from the date of credit of such amount in the Player's Winnings Account. In either case, FSL11 shall effect an online transfer to the Player's bank account on record with FSL11 within a commercially reasonable period of time. Such transfer will reflect as a debit to the Player's Winnings Account. FSL11 shall not charge any processing fee for the online transfer of such amount from the Winnings Account to the Player's bank account on record with FSL11. Players are requested to note that they will be required to provide valid photo identification and address proof documents for proof of identity and address in order for FSL11 to process the withdrawal request. The name mentioned on the Player's photo identification document should correspond with the name provided by the Player at the time of registration on FSL11, as well as the name and address existing in the records of the Player's bank account as provided to FSL11. In the event that no bank account has been registered by the Player against such Player's account with FSL11, or the Player has not verified his/her Player account with FSL11, to FSL11's satisfaction and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, FSL11 shall provide such Player with a notification to the Player's email address as on record with FSL11 at least 30 days prior to the Auto Transfer Date, and in case the Player fails to register a bank account with his/her Player Account and/or to verify his/her Player Account by the Auto Transfer Date, FSL11 shall be entitled to forfeit any amounts subject to transfer on the Auto Transfer Date. Failure to provide FSL11 with a valid bank account or valid identification documents (to FSL11's satisfaction) may result in the forfeiture of any amounts subject to transfer in accordance with this clause.</li>

                            <li>The Cash Bonus Account shall contain amounts gratuitously issued by FSL11 to the Player for use in participation in any Contests and no Player shall be permitted to transfer or request the transfer of any amount in to the Cash Bonus Account. The usage of any amounts issued and present in the Cash Bonus Account shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions, including without limitation, restrictions as to time within which such amount must be used, as applied by FSL11 and notified to the Player at the time of issue of such amount. The issue of any amount to the Cash Bonus Account is subject to the sole discretion of FSL11 and cannot be demanded by any Player as a matter of right. The issue of any such amount by FSL11 on any day shall not entitle the player to demand the issuance of such amount at any subsequent period in time nor create an expectation of recurring issue of such amount by FSL11 to such Player. The amount standing to the credit of the Player in the Cash Bonus Account may be used by such Player for the sole purpose of setting off against the participation fee in any Contest, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The amount standing to the credit of the Player in such Player's Cash Bonus Account shall not be withdraw-able or transferrable to any other account of the Player, including the bank account of such Player, or of any other Player or person, other that as part of the winnings of a Player in any Contests. In case the Player terminates his/her account with FSL11 or such account if terminated by FSL11, all amounts standing to the credit of such Player in the Cash Bonus Account shall return to FSL11 and the Player shall not have any right or interest in such amounts.</li>

                            <li>Players agree that once they confirm a transaction on FSL11, they shall be bound by and make payment for that transaction.</li>

                            <li>The Player acknowledges that transactions on FSL11 may take up to 24 hours to be processed. Any amount paid or transferred into the Player's 'Deposit' Account or Winnings Account may take up to 24 hours to reflect in the Player's 'Deposit' Account or Winnings Account balance. Similarly, money debited from the Player's Cash Bonus Account, 'Deposit' Account or Winnings Account may take up to 24 hours to reflect in the Player's 'Deposit' Account or Winnings Account balance. Players agree not to raise any complaint or claim against FSL11 in respect of any delay, including any lost opportunity to join any Contest or round due to delay in crediting of transaction amount into any of the Player's accounts
