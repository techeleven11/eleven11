                            <h>Fantasy Cricket Tips:</h3>
                            <p>Here are a few fantasy tips to give a kick-start to your fantasy IPL cricket.</p>
                            <p><b>● Know about the players:</b>The Indian Premier League consists of players from both, India and overseas. In terms of experience, the league comprises new players along with the stalwarts of the cricketing world. One major mistake that many fantasy cricket players do here is that they choose players based on their emotions rather than statistics. You should read about the recent performance of those players before taking them in the team. Many times, new players also perform better than stalwarts when the stalwarts return to the field after a long time. You must also ensure that you choose only such players who are playing the match. This is one of the best fantasy cricket tips.</p>
                            <p><b>● The Captain and Vice-Captain:</b> Just like the real-life teams have their captain and vice-captain, your fantasy cricket team also needs both. In fact, they are one of the most integral parts of the team because they bring you more points. Usually, a captain scores 2 times more points than the regular players while the vice-captain scores 1.5 times. This is why you’ll hear all the best fantasy cricket players give you this one fantasy tip- “Make all-rounders as captain and vice-captain". This is because they will earn you points from every sphere, batting as well as fielding or bowling. </p>
                            <p><b>● playing conditions:</b> All avid cricket fans know that the weather, type of pitch and any other environmental factors have an impact on the gameplay. While you are choosing your team, it is important to consider this also. For example, flat pitches help the batsmen score more runs. This means that if the match is going to take place in such a stadium, you should keep more batsmen in your team. Like, Sharjah Stadium is one such stadium. Most teams have touched high scores there.</p>
                            <p>Weather conditions also need to be taken into account. Good weather conditions are usually batsman's friends while overcast skies tend to have an inclination for the bowlers, due to the humid environment.</p>
                            <p><b>● Go for Top-Order batsman:</b> When selecting the batsmen in your team, one of the best fantasy cricket tips you will come across is selecting top-order batsmen. This is because the number 1 and 2 would definitely get to bat and the subsequent numbers are most likely to get a chance as well. They also get to face most of the deliveries giving them more time on the pavilion. This translates to more points for you.</p>
                            <p><b>● Invest well:</b> It is always advisable to invest wisely in fantasy cricket. In fact, investing in small portions is good advice because then even if you lose the money, it won’t hurt much. While if you invest huge chunks of money in one particular game, you would constantly be under pressure to choose a team that would earn you good returns. In case your fortune decides to leave your side, you might end up facing huge losses in this case.</p>
                            <p><b>● Read and Research:</b> Going online, you can find many resources about the stadiums and the players. Reading about them will help make the right decision while creating your team. Nowadays, even match predictions are posted online on several websites. They cover all the aspects that are to be taken care of while choosing the team, from pitch to weather. Reading those helps get a perspective.</p>
                            <p>The bottom line is, fantasy cricket is a great way to earn some extra penny while enjoying the match at the comfort of your house. Fans all over India are crazy for IPL and new innovations such as these take their excitement level to new limits. There’s no sure shot way to win at the game though. It is all about increasing your knowledge about cricket and the players and implementing it while choosing them. The fantasy tips mentioned here would surely help you make the choices better. So, what are you waiting for? Don’t just watch IPL but play it too!</p>
